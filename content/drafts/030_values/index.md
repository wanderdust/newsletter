Today I've been reflected on my values. It turns out my top level values, in order are these
- Spending time with Family
- Treat everyone with Kindness
- Spend more time in nature
- Never Stop learning
- Seek opportunities to build things yourself

It is not very surprising that my job -- where I spend almost half of my awakened life -- has little to do with my values, except for the part of learning, which is not really part of my job but rather I force myself to do this continously; and the building/programming part.

I say that it is not very surprising because over the past 3 years (mind you my professional career in tech is 5 years long) I have been very demotivated with my work, wondering what the point of all of it is.

The reason I moved into tech is because I stumbled into programming almost by accident, and the process of learning HTML to build websites, Javascript to make them interesting, ML to do some cool magic with data, was absolutely amazing. I spent about 3 years learning programming on my own, while I worked as a chef in a restaurant. I now start to realise that it is not programming what I loved, buth rather the process of continous learning, improving myself, giving myself capability to be autonomous on the internet. That was absouletly amazing.

Fast forward to now, where I have been in the industry for five years, all of that fascination is gone. THe continous learning diminshes more and more, as you get into the routine of building the same things over and over. Even the building part stops getting interesting. At the end of the day, as you move up in the industry, what matters is business, and I'm neither particularly good at it nor care about it.

Unfortunately I have a feeling that this will be a very important roadblock in my life. I need to make a decision as to continue, and try to make peace with my job and try and fit all the other things that are important to me around it, or I might need to make a radical choice to try and make a better life for myself. The main problem is that I have no plan, and don't know how to formulate one. It is not for lack of trying.

I will keep trying, and hope to get to a point where my job -- one of the biggest parts of my life -- brings me joy once again.

Until next time.
