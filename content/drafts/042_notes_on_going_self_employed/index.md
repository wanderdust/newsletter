# Contracting as a Software Engineer in Scotland


## 1. Lifestyle and Work Structure

**Flexibility**

* Outside IR35 means you are not tied to company working schedule. Very flexible


**Work Type**

* Normally not very exciting work.
* Fixed term.

**Finding Roles**

* Primarily via recruiters and LinkedIn (least preferred method)
* Contracts commonly 3 to 12 months.

---

## 2. IR35 and Legal Position

### Outside IR35

**Meaning**

* Engagement is considered genuine business to business.
* Client pays your Ltd company gross.
* You decide how income is extracted from the company.

**Key practical tests**

* **Control**: you determine how work is done.
* **Substitution**: genuine right to provide a substitute.
* **Mutuality of obligation**: no automatic right to ongoing work.
* **Integration**: not treated as internal staff.

Contract terms and real working practices must align.

### Important

* IR35 status is determined per contract.
* Medium and large clients issue a Status Determination Statement.
* HMRC can challenge status.
* Risk should be considered over multi year contracting.

---

## 3. Limited Company Structure (Scotland)

**Core setup**

* Ltd company registered with Companies House.
* Business bank account.
* Professional indemnity insurance.
* Accountant for payroll, VAT, accounts and corporation tax.

**Cash flow**

* Invoices typically paid monthly in arrears.
* Maintain both company and personal cash buffer.

---

## 4. Income Structure and Tax Optimisation

### 4.1 Corporation Tax

* 19% on profits up to £50,000.
* 25% above £250,000.
* Marginal relief between thresholds.

Corporation tax is paid before dividends.

---

### 4.2 Salary (Director Payroll)

Common approach:

* Pay a modest annual salary.
* Typically set between £6,000 and £12,570.
* Salary is deductible for corporation tax.
* Above Lower Earnings Limit counts toward state pension.
* Scottish income tax bands apply to salary.

Why keep salary moderate:

* Salary triggers employer and employee National Insurance.
* Dividends do not attract National Insurance.
* Single director companies generally cannot claim Employment Allowance.

Salary should be reviewed annually as thresholds change.

---

### 4.3 Dividends

**How they work**

* Paid from post corporation tax profits.
* Not deductible expenses.
* Must have sufficient retained earnings.

**Taxation**

* £500 dividend allowance at 0% (uses band).
* 8.75% basic rate.
* 33.75% higher rate.
* 39.35% additional rate.

Dividend rates are UK wide, including Scotland.

Your total taxable income determines which band applies.

---

### 4.4 Pension Contributions

Employer pension contributions:

* Paid directly by the company.
* Reduce corporation tax.
* No income tax or NI at contribution.
* Annual allowance generally £60,000, subject to tapering.

This is one of the most tax efficient mechanisms available.

---

## 5. Business Expenses

Reduce profit before corporation tax.

Typical:

* Accountant.
* Insurance.
* Equipment and software.
* Relevant training.
* Professional subscriptions.

Must be wholly and exclusively for business.

---
