In the last few months I have seen a lof of internet posts against AI for writing code. A lot of the given reasons are valid, such as agents producing lower quality code, quality control issues or ownership.

At the same time, over the past few months I have been going through an early mid-life crisis which has made me question the meaning of work and life purpose. I've been really pondering about what makes a life fullfilling and how closely related this might be related to the work you do.

Fullfilling of course being used as a loose term that means something around work giving oneself a sense of identity and satisfaction.

I've recently come to realise that software engineers are not afraid of AI taking over their jobs. The reason why they criticise these systems so much, despite how useful they've proven to be, is because "we" as software engineers are worried that by AI writing oun code, we will lose the one thing that gives us fullfillment in our jobs, and we will left to deal with everything else. In other words, we are then left to deal with the "business part".

To give an example, imagine an author. If you ask the author to give the LLM a prompt with a very detailed plot of the book, and tell them that the LLM will write the book so that they can ship a story to the readers a lot faster, I'm sure any self respecting author is going to tell you that's not why they got into writing in the first place.

The main difference between software engineers and authors is that code is a means to an end, whereas writing good literature may be the end itself.

Despite this big difference, I believe there is a lot in common between writers and software engineers. In both diciplines there is a process of thought, reflection and ultimately choosing the right words or code to express, in the case of the book the story or idea, and in the case of the software engineer the answer to the problem. You can go as far as saying that cade can be "beautiful", something that many of us have strived for, however this is not always practical and not serve any real purpose in our jobs besides feeling good about it ourselves.

I do see a world in the future where AI will be capable of independently handling more of the coding work, and this poses a threat to all of us who made a career from something that probably started as a hobby. The fear that our jobs will become all about the business side, and none about the coding side, which can be fullfilling in itself, but not the reason we got into it in the first part.

- Writing is part of the fullfillment, not only the story, but how it is carefully developed and communicated
- Coding is similar
