## Summary

I am an engineer specialising in Data Platforms and MLOps, with experience leading projects and collaborating across teams and stakeholders. I value operational excellence through strong team culture and collaboration. I thrive on an environment of continuous learning and growth.

## Experience

### FanDuel: Senior Data Engineer

Sep 2025 to today | Edinburgh, UK (remote)

As a Senior Data Engineer I worked on delivering timely data solutions to stakeholders.

- Led the migration of data from Salesforce to Databricks to align with new Platform strategy. Collaborated with Stakeholders to gather requirements and documented the outcomes.

### FanDuel: Data Platform Engineer

Sep 2023 to Sep 2025 | Edinburgh, UK (remote)

As a Platform Engineer I worked on a self serving Data API Platform to enable teams to access data in an easy and secure way.

- Collaborated in the design of the platform since day 1, from early architecture decisions through production rollout. Tech stack included Databricks, Spark, Postgres, Trino, Python, AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes and Kong.
- Streamlined Performance Testing on the APIs to ensure latency requirements were met under high load by creating a reusable Framework with Locust.
- Created Platfrom wide documentation for our customers. This creates a single place for knowledge, reduces support burden and encouraged team members to keep docs up to date.
- Led Projects such as the Reverse ETL strategy from Databricks to Postgres, or GraphQL adoption for the Platform. Collaborated with technical and non technical stakeholders to gather requirements and ensure expectations were met.
- Reduced time to troubleshoot production issues from hours to minutes by providing the team with tools to troubleshoot without having to rely on external teams.

### Zonda Satellite: MLOps Engineer

Jan 2022 to Sep 2023 | Glasgow, UK (remote)

As an MLOps Engineer I deployed Data Science Models to provide insights on the construction landscape in the United States.

- Led the development of a model to find similar properties in an area in real time via an API. The stack used was Snowflake, dbt, terraform, AWS (Batch), MongoDB, AWS Lambda and API Gateway.
- Created a re-usable MLOps framework to facilitate deployment of machine learning models using AWS Sagemaker and MLFlow reducing time to deploy.
- Introduced Grafana based monitoring for API performance and pipeline execution with alerting, improving time to detect and resolve issues.
- Mentored an intern on a project using Generative AI models (GANs and Stable Diffusion) for 3D object generation and collaborated closely with Product and stakeholders to keep delivery on track.

### Zonda Satellite: Machine Learning Engineer

Nov 2020 to Jan 2022 | Glasgow, UK (remote)

As a Machine Learning engineer, I worked on building and deploying Computer Vision Models to track construction activity via Satellite Imagery.

- Built an object detection model to track the development of new homes via Satellite Imagery. The stack used was Pythorch, MLFlow, AWS Batch, Docker and Terraform.
- Came up with a novel approach to predict construction progerss using time series data with KNN and data embeddings using Scikit Learn, and FastAPI to deploy the final model.
- Collaborated with non technical stakeholders to gather requirements, and keep in touch about ongoing progess to ensure requirements were met.

### KLU:  MLOps Engineer Consultant

Apr 2023 to May 2023 | Remote

As a Consultant, I helped KLU understand the performance of State of the Art LLMs,

- Fine tuned and deployed Alpaca 7B and 13B on a custom dataset and benchmarked models to support data driven deployment choices.
- Established best practices for model training and deployment on AWS using S3, DVC, Weights and Biases, Terraform, and SageMaker, with clear documentation for handover.


### Earlier

- UserTesting: Data Science Intern, Jun 2020 to Aug 2020. Built an unsupervised NLP model to flag inconsistent screener responses and shipped a small React interface to help QA review cases faster.

## Education

- MSc, Artificial Intelligence with Speech and Multimodal Interaction, Heriot Watt University, Edinburgh, 2020
- Degree in Commerce, Complutense University of Madrid, 2016

## Certifications

- AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional
- AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate
- Certified Kubernetes Application Developer
