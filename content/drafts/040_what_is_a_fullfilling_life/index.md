Over the last few months I've been going through a mid-life crisis about work and the key to living a fullfilled life. I am afraid I still have not found the answer, but I'm hoping that writing the whirl of thoughts in my brain down in paper (or bytes) will help tidy up my thoughts.

I've been pondering a lot about idleness, and whether that is the key to finding work/activities that make you fullfilled in your life. When I speak of idleness I am referring to "no pressure time off that gives you the autonomy to pursue an activity that is fullfilling and stimulating". In other words, if money wasn't an issue, how would you spend your time?

I've recently read an essay from Bertrand Russell called "In praise of idleness". In this essay he defends the idea that if we had the opportunity to work less (20 hours a week[verify]), then we would have more free time to pursue other activities that are more pleasurable to ourselves, therefore living a more fullfilled life. He argues that once we have enough automation to cover the basics to keep the  nation running, then we start to work less and have more leisure time.

This sounds like an ideal thing to me, give me more free time and I will find ways to be productive doing something I enjoy, such as gardening, app development or something else, however looking at today's world we can see that this idea has not really materialised.

 Rusell puts the example of a factory that creates pins. He says that once we reach an efficient enough process to create the right amount of pins to cover the nation's needs, then we can start working less by maintaining that production and distrubuting the workload amongst more staff, rather than having 2 people working 40 hours a week, we have 4 working 20 hours.

With the irruption of AI into the workplace we can clearly see that his idea has not materialised. Rather than software engineers having more free time now that they can delegate a big part of their jobs to AI, instead they are expected to be more productive by doing other work instead, or more parallel work. All the competitors have the same access to this technology, so if they are using it to stay ahead, so should we. But it makes you wonder, competition can be healthy for innovation, but when is too much innovation too much? When does it stop being "useful" to society and become merely "frivolous".

I do believe there is some truth in the idea that "idle time" can become a source of productivity. The way I see it is that if you have long enough time to get bored, you start to find things to do. It could be the case that the best you can come up with is going back to your 9-5 job to keep you sane, and that is perfectly reasonable. However I also feel like idle time can give you the opportunity to do other things that you would otherwise not do because if lack of time or energy. In my case I'd probably write more, or build more side projects or volunteer more, basically things that I find fullfilling in life. And who knows, perhaps that extra time would allow me to find ways to make a living out of them, allowing me to drop my current job and leading to a more fullfilled life.

I have thought about the idea of taking a week or two off and treat it as idle time specifically to see if it would help me find some answers, although I have the feeling that it would still not be enough time to fully invest into an idea. I'd probably spend the whole 2 weeks doing my garden, reading, writing blogs like this one or cycling, which would probably be good fun, but I'd end up going to my 9-5 work just like I did before, with no better plans for the future than when I took the time off.


This idea of fullfillment is something that has been eluding me in my life recently. I have an amazing wife and the best son I could ever ask for, and I live a lifestyle that makes me happy and I would like to say "fullfilled". I have a flexible job, and plenty of time to spend with my family, including a four day work week. However, even though I've managed to achieve all goals for an amazing work life balance, I still don't have that fullfillment. I find the idea of simply exchanging labor for money very depressing, and not really a sustainable way for me to live my life.

However I do think I have an idea of fullfillment feels like, I believe I've experienced it in the past when I first started learning web development. I am a self taught developer. After finishing a degree in marketing, I gave up on any careers to do with that and came to Scotland, got a job as a Chef in a restaurant and leared coding on my free time. This went on for about three years before I started looking for a formal certification in the field, in the form of a Masters degree, which eventually led me to landing my first job. During this time, I spent almost all of my free time learning to code by building several projects, mostly websites or webapps. Thinking back on it, I regret not making more out of it.


To summarise, I wish I had more idle time to figure out how to make a living out the things that bring me fullfillment in life, whether that is reading, writing, coding personal projects, gardening or anything else. This would be nice, but in practical terms I know it is not going to happen, so I'll still have to try to figure out the answers to my questions during my busy life, and hope I can come up with an answer sooner than later.

This brings me to the point of "pointless jobs". Some studies (reference) have pointed out that around 40% of people self diagnose that the jobs they do are pointless, and if they were to stop doing their jobs it would not have an impact in society. Most of this 40% were not people who performed manual labour such as builders waiters etc. Instead most of these people are the ones working in industries such as finance, insurance, entertainment etc. Building on my previous point, this has led me to believe that in our current society we seem to have created jobs that are pointless to society, but are really there for the sole purpose of keeping our current system going. Now, the meaning of pointless can be very abstract, and it depends of what we believe to be "the basic needs" for our society to function. For example, do we really need 100 brands wallets when we go to shop in amazon? Do we really need that much entertainment in TV, Radio and Phones? Does social media serve a legitimate societal purpose? Sure, competition drives innovation, but when is enough innovation enough?

[Revise above paragraph]

Can you be fullfillied in a pointless job? What does pointless mean? does it mean your labour produces no real output? or does it mean that you produce an output, but you feel like the company or industry you work for has no actual valid value in a society? --- Need to answer these questions.

Aristotle [actually verify and read this] was against instense labour. His idea of education was one where we would try to find in children those activities they found pleasurable early on, whether it was music, geometry, writing, building etc and use that to guide their careers. The idea is that by finding those activities that they found pleasurable as children, they would grow to do work that led to a fullfilling life. Of course, this work may not necessarily be something productive in the capitalist sense, for example someone may be good at being a good parent and that's how they may want to spend their life. However, even though that may not directly produce money or taxes, it can as well have a very positive impact in our society by empowering this person to do what fullfills them, but also by having a society where there is a choice to be able to make a living by raising your own children and not placing this task into someone else. And this can be true for other "non productive" activities such as praying, meditating, writing etc.

What it seems to me is that we live in a society that is advanced enough to be able to achieve all these things if we decided to, and allow people to be more fullfilled in their lifes. It is also true, that with our current system we have more opportunities than ever to make this possible on an individual level, and you will find a lot of people lucky enough to find their paid careers fullfilling, with it being something they would still do even if there was no money involved. However, I think that is the exception, and most people simply live in a situation where they exchange labour for money.

THis idea of fullfillment is something that has been eluding me in my life recently. I have an amazing wife and the best son I could ever ask for, and I live a lifestyle that makes me happy, and I would like to say "fullfilled", however my worklife does not match this sentiment. I am a self taught developer. After finishing a degree in marketing, I gave up on any careers to do with that and came to Scotland, got a job as a Chef in a restaurant and leared coding on my free time. This went on for about three years before I started looking for a formal certification in the field, in the form of a Masters degree, which eventually led me to landing my first job. During this time I was learning to code, I spent almost all of my free time learning to code by building several projects, mostly websites or webapps. Reflecting on it now, I can see that I felt very fullfilled during that period of my life, even though I still had to endure an exhausting 40h/week job in a restaurant that usually left me knakcered after every shift. I can't help that think that if I still had that "idle" time to learn and bulid things today outside of my job today, I could produce something that would make me more fullfilled, finding out ways to monetise it (something I regret not doing back in the day with my projects), leading to a more fullfilling work life.

The only thing stopping me is probably the same thing that stops a lot of people from trying to pursue more fullfilling careers in their lifes, I now have mortgage and a family to care for, and my current job gives me what I feel is the right amount of money for labour to make meets end and still have enough leftover to leave comfortably afterwards, even if the work itself is not fullfilling in any way.

I don't think I believe we should have more free time to be happy, but spending our time doing fullfilling activities that in an ideal world gives us enough money to still live our lifes. I might be creating dreams in my head, but when I see the farmer going up the road to the farms on a sunday morning at 7am, I can't help but think that even though his work is 24h and 7 days a week (like anyone who owns a business really) he must feel very good about his work, and likely very fullfilled. Can't really see him really about having a 9-5 desk job.

And I guess this is my final point, 9-5 jobs seems to be a made up bracket of our day to spend our working hours. I can see the benefits of having a period of time where every employee is working at the same time, and also forcing some structure to everyone's day. However it seems to me that the idea of having to be productive during those hours, no matter whether there is actual useful work to do or not very inefficient. Seems to me like in an ideal world, you work when you need to. This might mean that you end up working 80 hours a week or 10 hours a week depending on the nature of the work, but of course I can recognise that this would only really work for those who own their own business, so perhaps this is the direction I need to head towards to in the future, and I'm just delaying the inevitable.

- What is the point of this blog post? I think it should be more focused into finding answers to fullfillment rather than writing about academic stuff.
