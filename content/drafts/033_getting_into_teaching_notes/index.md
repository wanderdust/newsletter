## Experience Without a PhD

Definitely possible to get into teaching without a PhD.

  - For teaching assistant, there's not really a requirement for teaching experience. 
  - For teaching fellow, teaching experience can put you ahead someone with a PhD. Required to enter at this level.

    
## Job Advert Search
  - Don't look for jobs in informatics. Instead search across disciplines where they are looking for data-driven approaches. Look for the **Data** keyword
  - Look at the criteria and check which criteria you meet and which criteria you are missing. Try to get experience in the missing criteria. Interviewers will do a _box checking_ excercise and the most criteria you meet the more chances of an interview.
