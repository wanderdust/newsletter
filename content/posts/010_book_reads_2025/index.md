## Fiction 

#### Orbital
This one tells the story of a team of 5 austronauts in their space mission. It is less than a 100 pages long, but it is one of those books that requires your full attention, where every sentence and every word counts. It is beautifully written.

#### Stormlight Archives 5: Wind and Truth

Brandon Sanderson never dissapoints. Like all of Stormlight Archives, the longer the book the better because you never want it to end. Such an epic saga and such an epic book, can't wait to see what comes next.

#### Augustus

## Travel

#### A Journey for Madmen

This book came to me in the form of a christmas present, and I have to say what a great gift! The book set in the 1960's and it tells the real story about a group sailors that sail their boats solo and non-stop around the world. The story is really well written, and such an inspiration to go do more exciting adventures in life.

I have no idea of sailing, and have never set foot on a sailboat in my life, but after reading this book all I want to do is to buy a boat and sail across the world.
