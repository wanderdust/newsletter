How preparing for the skyscanner interview made me learn more about system design. These are skills that I can currently use in my current role,
- Postgres replication (read/write)
- Understanding Failover
- Getting into kafka and how they use sharding to scale horizontally - the advantages of that. 
- Where our system lacks in scalability (single replica, no writer horizantal scaling etc)
