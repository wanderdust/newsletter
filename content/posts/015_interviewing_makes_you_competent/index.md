How preparing for the skyscanner interview made me learn more about system design. These are skills that I can currently use in my current role,
(Summary: better understand Postgres and Distributed Apps)
- Postgres replication (read/write)
- Understanding Failover
- Getting into kafka and how they use sharding to scale horizontally - the advantages of that. 
- Where our system lacks in scalability (single replica, no writer horizantal scaling etc)

How interviewing for internal role made me go for AWS ARchitect cert
(Summary: better understand RDS & Aurora in AWS, and a bunch of other AWS services)
- Got feedback indicating that I was a good candidate, but my AWS knowledge was not enough
- Interviewer recommended course, AWS Architect associate - which I did
- Get to better understand AWS services, and deep dive into the fundamentals. Spend time on topics I had used but never stopped to properly understand
- Compare EKS to AWS services, to see similar things and different
