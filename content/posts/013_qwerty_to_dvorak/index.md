This is an interview to Pablo, who started learning DVORAK in january 2025. This is an interview about his learning experience.


**What is Dvorak?**

DVORAK is a keyboard layout created in the 30s proposed as a more efficient alternative to qwerty. Dvorak groups letters on the keyboard based on how often they are used (in the english language), so the most used ones are located in the "home row" and less used ones are located in locations that require further finger reach.


**Why did you learn DVORAK? Were there any issues with QWERTY that prompted you to move away from it?**

THere is absolutely nothing wrong with qwerty. Some people learn dvorak because it is supposed to enable you to have an even faster typing speed. I just wanted to learn it because it sounded like fun.

I rememember the typing lessons in school quite fondly, and I wanted to re-create the experience.

I've also always enjoyed learning new langugages, but because I never get to practice my german or portuguese I just forgot them almost completely. Learning Dvorak felt almost close enough to learning a new langague. I get to use it every day, so there's no risk of losing it.

**Did you consider other keyboard layouts?**

I started learning Dvorak as a fun excercise after having heard about it from a couple different sources. At the time I didn't really do much research into it, I just wanted to learn for fun.

Only after a few months of learning I started to do a bit of research into the world of typing, and found out about other alternatives such as Colemak which sounds like an awesome layout as well. If I had know about it back then perhaps I would have chosen it instead.

**How did you start learning it?**

I went online an searched for "Learn DVORAK", and a website called typing.com came up. It has a couple of courses on learning DVORAK which were a really good start. As my progression and typing speed got better, I moved towards monkeytype.com, which is very nice, because it has different modes and keeps track of your progression.

Learning where the keys are without looking (touch typing) takes a few days - at a very slow pace at the beggining of course. After you start getting a bit more confident at knowing where the keys are, I started to use it in my day to day. 


**Do you need to buy a special keyboard to learn?**

Not at all. The best way to learn is to use your qwerty keyboard and simply change the layout in your system settings. In mac you can have both enabled and quickly switch  between the two.

A lot of people also mention using mechanical keyboards to type and learn "faster". In my opinion mechanical keyboards don't make a difference at all, except make your desk look cooler (I would know, I spent £100 on one). Any keyboard will do.


**Once you get past that initial phase, how do you progress?**

I was practising about 30 minutes a day each day. After a couple of weeks I finished the the courses from typing.com. My typing speed was about 30 words per minute (for context, I could type at ~85 wpm with qwerty) at that point so I decided to start using DVORAK for my daily job tasks. Replying to slack messages was painful, specially since the person on the other side can see you've been typing 10 minutes for a 2 line message. You start getting good at getting straight to the point to avoid typing long messages.

Also at that point when I was almost using DVORAK full time, I started to mix up qwerty and DVORAK. My brain was starting to forget how to qwerty, so I really had no choice but make the full switch. I would recommend to switch gradually if you can, but I didn't really have the choice!

There were times where I was advancing really quickly to go from 5 to 30 WPM in a week or two, and other times where I'd plateau at a specific speed and feel like wasn't making any progress.


**Wait there! So you forgot how to type in qwerty?!**

Indeed I have. For a few days I kept switching, using Qwerty for any tasks than required some speed and Dvorak for everything else. At one point when trying to type Qwerty, I would mix up my keys with the Dvorak layout. My brain had all of a sudden forgotten how Qwerty.

A lot of guides online say you can learn them side by side. But what they forget to mention is that you lose qwerty in the process, and you have to make an effort to re-learn it after you learn DVORAK. I've read online that it takes a couple of months of practice to get qwerty back. I wouldn't know, because I can't be bothered to go through this again.

**How do you get over the plateaus where you felt you weren't getting any faster?**

At around week 7, I wrote this in my notes:

> *Learning this is a lot harder than I thought. I can write fast enough now (around 50wpm on avg?) but still my fingers feel very unsure of some keys and it is very frustrating. I make a lot of mistakes while typing which can be infuriating and frustrating at the same time. I’m doing my best to get better but the process is a lot slower than I was hoping. If I could go back I would probably not bother.*

The first thing I would recommend when learning dvorak is to have your expectations set very low. Your progress will depend on how much effort you put into learning.

Also, to get faster you need to keep practising. Using it full time in your every day work will only get you so far, but if you want to be a fast typist you need to keep the practice going. I stopped practising after week 8, and after 7 months I've plateaued at 65-70WPM. This speed is good enough for me.

If I can give one tip, is that slow is fast: focusing on accuracy and making few mistakes will get you faster speeds than fast typing where you have to keep correcting mistakes. It will also stop you from learning bad habbits.


**How did learning affect your productivity?**

I decided to start learning during a period of time where work wasn't too busy. At the beggining it dooes not affect you much because you can switch back to qwerty whenever you need to do actual work. But at the point where you start forgetting qwerty and need to fully commit to DVORAK for your day to day, your productivity can slow down a bit for a couple of weeks. But only really if you have to do much typing.

For me, as a programmer, I don't really need to type that much unless I'm writing a confluence doc or replying to slack.

For programming I can usually take my time, and I normally don't need to write lots of code at a fast pace.


**You started learning DVORAK over 7 months ago, how is it going now?**

I can type at about 70WPM vs the 85WPM I could type on QWERTY. At this point it takes a concious effort to try to increase typing speed, which I'd need to practice it. 70 WPM is fast enough for what I need, so I'm not practicing to go any faster.


**Have you noticed any physical benefits or drawbacks?**

Can't say I have seen any benefits. My life feels the same as it did when I typed qwerty. Except for the bragging rights of being a nerd.


**Any tips for anyone who wants to learn?**

Keep your expectations low. Your progression will depend on how much and how well you practice, but it is likely to take some time before you reach a speed you are happy enough with.

If you are switching because you want to type faster, it is very likely that DVORAK won't help. I've seen people type at ridiculous speeds with Qwerty (200WPM+).

If you want to learn, remember it will take time, and make sure to try and enjoy the process.


**I read a blog post from you where you mention you use vim, how was re-learning VIM mappings in DVORAK?**

I started learning Dvorak only after a couple months of using vim, so my vim knowledge was not so extensive that it would bother me te re-learn it. The nice thing about VIM is that the key mappings have actual meanings (`diw` -> delete in word; `vt;` -> view to next colon ';'), so it is quite easy to keep using them with the new layout.

One of the more annoying things is losing the navigation keys `hjkl`. But even then, the way it works out it is not too bad, with dvorak you get the horizontal movement on the right hand (index and pinky fingers) and vertical movement in your left hand (both on the index finger). 

Another slightly annoying thing is that a lot of the symbols useful for programming land on the pinky finger of the right hand, which makes them a bit harder to hit cleanly. 


**So, is it worth it?**

No, not really.

It takes a few weeks/months of practice to get to a reasonable speed, and it doesn't really bring any benefits, at least for the casual typer person like me. Of course there is always the nice feeling of having learned something new. 

But if what you are looking for is to challenge yourself and learn something new then absolutely go for it. Usually the most useless projects are the most fun to learn.

Have fun and keep learning.

## Resources

Some helpful resources that supported me throughout the Dvorak learning process:

- [dvzine.org – What is Dvorak?](https://www.dvzine.org/zine/index.html)  
  A fun and well-designed zine that explains the motivation behind Dvorak and its advantages.

- [typing.com](https://www.typing.com)  
  Great for beginners. Includes structured Dvorak courses with progression tracking.

- [monkeytype.com](https://monkeytype.com)  
  Sleek interface with many custom modes. Best for real-world word practice and measuring speed/accuracy.

- [keybr.com](https://www.keybr.com)  
  Focuses on weak spots by generating words based on your error patterns. Great for targeted improvement. Although I didn't really see that many benefits from it

## Notes

What is Dvorak? - https://www.dvzine.org/zine/index.html

Motivation for learning it?

Just thought it would be fun

I enjoyed learning languages, but since I don’t practice them they get forgotten. THis is an excuse to learn a “language” that I get to use everyday

The Goal

Type at 100wpm

Current qwerty speed is around 85wpm (on typing.com 1 minute test)

Describe the setup

Touch typing. Dont bother about getting a keyboard. If anything buy a mechanical keyboard and swap the keys.

Add DVORAK as additional layout on mac. Then you can easily swap between them using the fn key.

Progress Keeping

For keeping track of speed I do the test from typing.com (1 minute test) because that one was the first one I started using. Also I feel these tests have a lot harder words as compared to monkeytype. THey also include punctuation and numbers in some cases. All my tests have at least 95% accuracy.

Monnkeytype

Additional Context

Started learning Vim and using Neovim just a couple months earlier

Resources

typing.com

keybr.com

monkeytype.com

## Week 1: The Beginning

• My QWERTY speed is around 85 WPM before switching.

• I start using a QWERTY keyboard with Dvorak mappings, which means I’m learning to type without looking from the very beginning.

• Practicing 15-30 minutes daily.

• Doing the Dvorak course on typing.com, repeating most lessons until I get 95%+ accuracy.

• Touch typing is easy! —within one day, I learn the home row (aoeui dhtn). Within three days, I learn the full layout.

• Starting speed: 10 WPM.

• Trying to switch to Dvorak full-time after 3-4 days once I memorise the keys.

• Slack messages are painful.

• Still have to use QWERTY for coding and Vim.

• For shell and code, I have to switch back to QWERTY.

• My brain sometimes forgets QWERTY when switching back, so I have to look at the keyboard.

## Week 2: Getting Comfortable

• Re-learning Vim is a hassle. Good thing I had only just started learning it a few weeks before switching to Dvorak.

• Typing speed after 14 days: 29 WPM.

• By week 1.5, I start having glimpses of typing without thinking—but only for easy words such as “these” and “where”.

• Some words are easier than others, while others are frustratingly difficult.

• Struggling with J, Q, I, U, and K—I have to think extra hard to get them right.

• As soon as I switch “more” fully to Dvorak, switching back to QWERTY stops working. It’s like my brain has completely forgotten QWERTY.

• Now I’m forced to type in Dvorak at 30 WPM—no way back. Slack messaging is slow and painful. People on the other side must think I type using only my index finger.

## Week 3: Pushing Through

Started using Dvorak in Vim after two weeks.

• The process is painful at first.

• Luckily, I’m not an expert, so I don’t have to relearn a bunch of movements.

• Vim’s keybindings are well-designed, making the transition a bit easier.

• At the start of week 3, Vim starts to feel better.

• Still slow, but no longer painful.

• Some words now flow without thinking! Feels amazing.

• Started using Monkeytype to practise with punctuation and numbers.

• I never properly learned the numbers on QWERTY, so I need to get good at them now.

• I wish the number row had tactile marks like F and J.

• Slow is fast.

• When I focus on accuracy, I type at the same speed as when I try to type fast but make mistakes.

• Fixing mistakes slows me down more than just typing carefully.

• Breaking the 30 WPM barrier feels great.

• Now averaging 35 WPM, but I feel like I’m stuck here forever.

• Goal: Get faster than my QWERTY speed (85 WPM)—but right now, it feels impossible.

Feel like I’m going to be stuck in the 30’s forever!

Today I have taken the 3 minute typing test 3 times and got 43,40 and 44 WPM. Seems like I’m slowly getting there! I think the fewer mistakes I make the faster my speed.

At this rate it will take me a few months to get to the 100 WPM mark :sigh:



## Week 4

What have I done. I will never get fast at this. I was hoping to be 100wpm within one month

I still have trouble with the ‘d,i,f,k,q,y’ keys mostly

I’m going to try to practice 100% accuracy even if I’m slow see if that improves my typing 

First try today and got 44 wpm speed! Nice. Feeling pumped. 48 on the second with 95% accuracy!

By the way I only count it if I get over 95% accuracy and test that are long (at least 100 words)

Very frustrated. My speed seems to go up slowly but I still make a lot of mistakes which I think is slowing me down but also creating bad habbits. I need to slow dow and get 100% accuracy before I try going back to typing fast.

I’ve changed the settings so I fail any test if my accuracy goes below 98%. It’s quite hard. I can only afford one mistake. I am going to focus on accuracy and let the speed come later

I need to be careful, because bad habits form when I’m not practicing. So need to be extra mindful to retain accuracy when I’m typing emails or slack

I can get up to 55 wpm on shorter typing tests

The weirdest thing is getting used to the punctuation being in the places where qwerty used to have letters.

After doing the speed test I’m sitting at around 48wpm. Not a lot of improvement since last week! I think I will go back to do some muscle memory exercises.

## Week 5

Went back to the basics. Started practicing the home row a lot to get good muscle memory. Trying to get good muscle memory to stop making repeated mistakes when typing faster https://learn.dvorak.nl/?lang=en&lesson=2

I can get up to 70wpm on short sentences (i.e 10 words). It gets harder when you try 50+ words with at least 98% accuracy.

I feel like I’m making snow progress. Speed does not get a lot faster, but I feel like I can type longer tests without making many mistakes. I can type about 53 to 60wpm for 50 words with over 98% accuracy (thats about a maximum of 2 mistakes)

I can do about 53 WPM on the typing test with 96% accuracy. 49% at the 3 minute test

I should have never started learining dvorak. I was expecting to be a lot faster sooner so I think my expectations were to high. AAAAGGGHHHRR

I’ve started using https://www.keybr.com/ which is a website that tracks your mistakes and gets you to practice on words that you find hard. Hopefully it pays off because I feel like I’ve plateaued at 49-60wpm

started feeling pain in my left wrist for the first time today. It started when I was heavily practicing typing ‘qu’ words

The goal of achieving 100wpm seems impossible now

Practicing the j and the q real hard. I really suck at those! Also I am really slow at ck which is a very recurring set of words

I’m starting to feel a bit more agile with VIM again.

Typing speed test was 57 with 98% accuracy (a tricky test with hard words!). The tests were quite tricky, I took about 5 different ones and got 57 on all of them except the last one where I got 64% with 97% accuracy

## Week 6

Smashing 60 to 72 wpm on keybr practice.

Sick and off typing for the rest of the week



## Week 7

Learning this is a lot harder than I thought. I can write fast enough now (around 50wpm on avg?) but still my fingers feel very unsure of some keys and it is very frustrating. I make a lot of mistakes while typing which can be infuriating and frustrating at the same time. I’m doing my best to get better but the process is a lot slower than I was hoping. If I could go back I would probably not bother.

I read plenty of stories online of people getting up to 100wpm within a month which gave me so much false hope. I don’t know if thats all bullshit and people are trying to make themselves look good, or perhaps I’m just not good at this. Maybe they practice more than me.

## Week 10

It’s been a few weeks where I’ve been busy and I’ve not been able to practice as much

keybr.com is not that useful. I feel like all the words are very short and you don’t get to practice as many words

I’m back to monkeytype, I’m practicing the top 5k english words because that seems to be the test that I find the most difficult to get top accuracy out of all the things I’ve tried so far. I’m still averaging around 55wpm which is not much, but feeling hopeful today.

I was hitting 65wpm in the afternoon with the same tests. Do I write faster in the evenings when I’ve warmed up?

Typing at the 61 mark

## Week 11

Typed at 69WPM on monkeytype today with 96% accuracy

I found that when you look at the word that you need to type and you quickly process it in your brain and acknowledge what word it is, and then you start looking at the next word while you finish typing this one, it helps you write faster and more confident. What happens is that you acknowledge the word and you are also acknowledging that you know how to type it then your brain does the rest of the work. If you instead look at the word letter by letter and you have not acknowledged it your brain, you don’t know what letter is coming next, so you need to think about each individual word which slows you down. This is why you struggle more with rare words that you don’t know the spelling of straight away. 





## Week … who knows

It’s been a few weeks since I’ve added anything to this diary. I feel like I’ve plateaued. I’m not really practicing as much these days beyond what I have to write for work or during my writing for blog posts.

I’m writing at 55-65 wpm on average. Although I occasionally hit the 70+ mark, but very rarely.

Suprisingly, I tend to do better when I’m typing and my brain is thinking about something else. I’m pretty sure that I type faster than my score in monkeytype, but we’ll never know. The more I focus the more mistakes I make. 


Its been at least 4 weeks since my last entry. I have stopped trying to improve my speed, it is good enough by this point (60s or so). THe only thing I want now is to re-learn qwerty, but I cannot be bothered!
