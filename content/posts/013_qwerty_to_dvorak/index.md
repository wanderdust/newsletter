What is Dvorak? - https://www.dvzine.org/zine/index.html

Motivation for learning it?

Just thought it would be fun

I enjoyed learning languages, but since I don’t practice them they get forgotten. THis is an excuse to learn a “language” that I get to use everyday

The Goal

Type at 100wpm

Current qwerty speed is around 85wpm (on typing.com 1 minute test)

Describe the setup

Touch typing. Dont bother about getting a keyboard. If anything buy a mechanical keyboard and swap the keys.

Add DVORAK as additional layout on mac. Then you can easily swap between them using the fn key.

Progress Keeping

For keeping track of speed I do the test from typing.com (1 minute test) because that one was the first one I started using. Also I feel these tests have a lot harder words as compared to monkeytype. THey also include punctuation and numbers in some cases. All my tests have at least 95% accuracy.

Monnkeytype

Additional Context

Started learning Vim and using Neovim just a couple months earlier

## Week 1: The Beginning

• My QWERTY speed is around 85 WPM before switching.

• I start using a QWERTY keyboard with Dvorak mappings, which means I’m learning to type without looking from the very beginning.

• Practicing 15-30 minutes daily.

• Doing the Dvorak course on typing.com, repeating most lessons until I get 95%+ accuracy.

• Touch typing is easy! —within one day, I learn the home row (aoeui dhtn). Within three days, I learn the full layout.

• Starting speed: 10 WPM.

• Trying to switch to Dvorak full-time after 3-4 days once I memorise the keys.

• Slack messages are painful.

• Still have to use QWERTY for coding and Vim.

• For shell and code, I have to switch back to QWERTY.

• My brain sometimes forgets QWERTY when switching back, so I have to look at the keyboard.

## Week 2: Getting Comfortable

• Re-learning Vim is a hassle. Good thing I had only just started learning it a few weeks before switching to Dvorak.

• Typing speed after 14 days: 29 WPM.

• By week 1.5, I start having glimpses of typing without thinking—but only for easy words such as “these” and “where”.

• Some words are easier than others, while others are frustratingly difficult.

• Struggling with J, Q, I, U, and K—I have to think extra hard to get them right.

• As soon as I switch “more” fully to Dvorak, switching back to QWERTY stops working. It’s like my brain has completely forgotten QWERTY.

• Now I’m forced to type in Dvorak at 30 WPM—no way back. Slack messaging is slow and painful. People on the other side must think I type using only my index finger.

## Week 3: Pushing Through

Started using Dvorak in Vim after two weeks.

• The process is painful at first.

• Luckily, I’m not an expert, so I don’t have to relearn a bunch of movements.

• Vim’s keybindings are well-designed, making the transition a bit easier.

• At the start of week 3, Vim starts to feel better.

• Still slow, but no longer painful.

• Some words now flow without thinking! Feels amazing.

• Started using Monkeytype to practise with punctuation and numbers.

• I never properly learned the numbers on QWERTY, so I need to get good at them now.

• I wish the number row had tactile marks like F and J.

• Slow is fast.

• When I focus on accuracy, I type at the same speed as when I try to type fast but make mistakes.

• Fixing mistakes slows me down more than just typing carefully.

• Breaking the 30 WPM barrier feels great.

• Now averaging 35 WPM, but I feel like I’m stuck here forever.

• Goal: Get faster than my QWERTY speed (85 WPM)—but right now, it feels impossible.

Feel like I’m going to be stuck in the 30’s forever!

Today I have taken the 3 minute typing test 3 times and got 43,40 and 44 WPM. Seems like I’m slowly getting there! I think the fewer mistakes I make the faster my speed.

At this rate it will take me a few months to get to the 100 WPM mark :sigh:



## Week 4

What have I done. I will never get fast at this. I was hoping to be 100wpm within one month

I still have trouble with the ‘d,i,f,k,q,y’ keys mostly

I’m going to try to practice 100% accuracy even if I’m slow see if that improves my typing 

First try today and got 44 wpm speed! Nice. Feeling pumped. 48 on the second with 95% accuracy!

By the way I only count it if I get over 95% accuracy and test that are long (at least 100 words)

Very frustrated. My speed seems to go up slowly but I still make a lot of mistakes which I think is slowing me down but also creating bad habbits. I need to slow dow and get 100% accuracy before I try going back to typing fast.

I’ve changed the settings so I fail any test if my accuracy goes below 98%. It’s quite hard. I can only afford one mistake. I am going to focus on accuracy and let the speed come later

I need to be careful, because bad habits form when I’m not practicing. So need to be extra mindful to retain accuracy when I’m typing emails or slack

I can get up to 55 wpm on shorter typing tests

The weirdest thing is getting used to the punctuation being in the places where qwerty used to have letters.

After doing the speed test I’m sitting at around 48wpm. Not a lot of improvement since last week! I think I will go back to do some muscle memory exercises.

## Week 5

Went back to the basics. Started practicing the home row a lot to get good muscle memory. Trying to get good muscle memory to stop making repeated mistakes when typing faster https://learn.dvorak.nl/?lang=en&lesson=2

I can get up to 70wpm on short sentences (i.e 10 words). It gets harder when you try 50+ words with at least 98% accuracy.

I feel like I’m making snow progress. Speed does not get a lot faster, but I feel like I can type longer tests without making many mistakes. I can type about 53 to 60wpm for 50 words with over 98% accuracy (thats about a maximum of 2 mistakes)

I can do about 53 WPM on the typing test with 96% accuracy. 49% at the 3 minute test

I should have never started learining dvorak. I was expecting to be a lot faster sooner so I think my expectations were to high. AAAAGGGHHHRR

I’ve started using https://www.keybr.com/ which is a website that tracks your mistakes and gets you to practice on words that you find hard. Hopefully it pays off because I feel like I’ve plateaued at 49-60wpm

started feeling pain in my left wrist for the first time today. It started when I was heavily practicing typing ‘qu’ words

The goal of achieving 100wpm seems impossible now

Practicing the j and the q real hard. I really suck at those! Also I am really slow at ck which is a very recurring set of words

I’m starting to feel a bit more agile with VIM again.

Typing speed test was 57 with 98% accuracy (a tricky test with hard words!). The tests were quite tricky, I took about 5 different ones and got 57 on all of them except the last one where I got 64% with 97% accuracy

## Week 6

Smashing 60 to 72 wpm on keybr practice.

Sick and off typing for the rest of the week



## Week 7

Learning this is a lot harder than I thought. I can write fast enough now (around 50wpm on avg?) but still my fingers feel very unsure of some keys and it is very frustrating. I make a lot of mistakes while typing which can be infuriating and frustrating at the same time. I’m doing my best to get better but the process is a lot slower than I was hoping. If I could go back I would probably not bother.

I read plenty of stories online of people getting up to 100wpm within a month which gave me so much false hope. I don’t know if thats all bullshit and people are trying to make themselves look good, or perhaps I’m just not good at this. Maybe they practice more than me.

## Week 10

It’s been a few weeks where I’ve been busy and I’ve not been able to practice as much

keybr.com is not that useful. I feel like all the words are very short and you don’t get to practice as many words

I’m back to monkeytype, I’m practicing the top 5k english words because that seems to be the test that I find the most difficult to get top accuracy out of all the things I’ve tried so far. I’m still averaging around 55wpm which is not much, but feeling hopeful today.

I was hitting 65wpm in the afternoon with the same tests. Do I write faster in the evenings when I’ve warmed up?

Typing at the 61 mark

## Week 11

Typed at 69WPM on monkeytype today with 96% accuracy

I found that when you look at the word that you need to type and you quickly process it in your brain and acknowledge what word it is, and then you start looking at the next word while you finish typing this one, it helps you write faster and more confident. What happens is that you acknowledge the word and you are also acknowledging that you know how to type it then your brain does the rest of the work. If you instead look at the word letter by letter and you have not acknowledged it your brain, you don’t know what letter is coming next, so you need to think about each individual word which slows you down. This is why you struggle more with rare words that you don’t know the spelling of straight away. 





## Week … who knows

It’s been a few weeks since I’ve added anything to this diary. I feel like I’ve plateaued. I’m not really practicing as much these days beyond what I have to write for work or during my writing for blog posts.

I’m writing at 55-65 wpm on average. Although I occasionally hit the 70+ mark, but very rarely.

Suprisingly, I tend to do better when I’m typing and my brain is thinking about something else. I’m pretty sure that I type faster than my score in monkeytype, but we’ll never know. The more I focus the more mistakes I make. 


Its been at least 4 weeks since my last entry. I have stopped trying to improve my speed, it is good enough by this point (60s or so). THe only thing I want now is to re-learn qwerty, but I cannot be bothered!
