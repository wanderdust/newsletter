## Introduction

One of the best things about serverless is how easy it is to get started. You don’t need to worry about infrastructure, scaling groups, or servers—you just deploy and go.

It’s also incredibly cheap for small projects or apps with modest traffic. Hosting a static site on S3 and wiring it up with CloudFront? A few dollars a month. Adding Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB? Still pennies for small workloads.

But here’s the catch: the same magic that lets your app scale smoothly from 0 to hundreds of requests can also scale into thousands of requests if someone decides to run a DDoS attack—or even just accidentally spams your endpoint. Without guardrails, you can end up with an eye-watering AWS bill.

This post walks through a sample serverless setup (S3 + CloudFront, API Gateway + Lambda, DynamoDB) and highlights what you can do to keep your costs predictable and your application safe.

## S3 and CloudFront

**Cache Aggressively with CloudFront**.
Every request that CloudFront serves directly is one less request hitting your S3 bucket. This reduces S3 read costs and, more importantly, avoids unnecessary data transfer charges.

**Restrict Direct Access to S3**
Add a bucket policy so only CloudFront can access your files. This prevents people from bypassing caching and hammering your bucket directly.

## API Gateway

**Enable Rate Limiting**
Use API Gateway’s usage plans and throttling features to set sensible per-user and per-API limits. This protects against brute force traffic spikes.

**Add Authentication**
Don’t expose your API to the entire internet without checks. At minimum, validate JWTs (e.g., Cognito, Auth0). This ensures requests come from valid clients.

**Lock Down CORS**
Only allow requests from your known frontend domain(s). This prevents random websites from abusing your API in browser contexts.

⸻

## Lambda
**Set Reserved Concurrency**
By default, Lambda can scale up very quickly. If your function is tied to costly downstream services (like DynamoDB), set a reserved concurrency limit. This caps how many functions can run at once and gives you cost predictability. It also ensures other applications using lambda will still be able to run even if your application is at max capacity.

**Think About Failure Modes**
If Lambda is overwhelmed, do you want to queue requests, or should they fail fast? Designing with limits in mind avoids runaway cost scenarios.

⸻

## DynamoDB
**Use DAX for Caching**
DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) helps reduce repeated queries. By serving cached responses, you cut costs and improve latency.

**Apply Resource-Based Policies**
Restrict DynamoDB access to just your Lambda functions. This ensures nobody can hit your tables directly.

⸻

## Conclusion

Serverless gives you power and flexibility with minimal effort—but that same ease of scaling can backfire if you’re not careful. By putting guardrails in place across S3, CloudFront, API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB, you can prevent an innocent project (or a malicious attacker) from running up thousands in AWS costs.

Think of these controls as your seatbelt. You might not always need them—but you’ll be glad they’re there when something goes wrong.
