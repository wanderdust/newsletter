I've been having a lot of thoughts lately about career satisfaction and the meaning of the work I do. I have this feeling that the work we do should mean something more than just a way to make money so we can live our lifes.

Whenever I think about my purpose as a software engineer in any company, I get this feeling that I'm not really doing anything worthwhile. I have this pessimistic thought that we've reached a point where companies don't really solve any meaningful problems anymore. Let melaborate:

I was recently reading Rusell's essay *[In praise of Idleness](https://harpers.org/archive/1932/10/in-praise-of-idleness/)*, where he mentions that during World War One, most of the population was fighting the war, and only a small percentage of the population was in the workforce, and still the country managed just fine to get everything it needed. He then goes to suggest that if we kept that level of production post-war, with the increased number of people available to work, we could reduce the working hours by taking shorter shifts and being able to enjoy a much more fulfilling life where work does not take up most of our lifes.

As it turns out, we didn't do that, and instead everyone when to work full time, new companies were created, many competitors for the same product arised. To the point where we produce more than we need. This is clearly visible in the products we buy, you only need to open your amazon account to see the amount of shitty brands that come up when you search for any product. And I feel this is the same with software, companies are working on products that don't solve a real need, but rather new artificial needs are created for the purpose of companies to make more money.

And it seems like the problem I have is not so much with software engineering, but with Capitalism itself. All of this over-production is a byproduct of our economic system, and it doesn't seem like it is going to change any time soon.

Going back to my problem, I simply don't see a way of moving forward in my career as it currently stands. As a senior engineer, I'm not motivated to go up the ladder to become a staff engineer or a manager. I simply don't feel I can live my life honestly working towards something I don't believe in. I'm not sure if this is immaturity from my part, and I will somehow get over it eventually, or perhaps I care about this more than other people.

Sometimes I try to focus on just the tech part at work, and try no too think about anything else outside of it. I really enjoy learning new things, building stuff, and tech is the perfect landspace to enable all of that. Perhaps I could stay a senior engineer all my life, where I don't really need to get involved in any of the business stuff and the stress that comes with it. It would be an easy life. However, work takes up a big chunk of our lifes. Even if you work a remote 4 day work week like myself (part time), I still feel like work takes up the "most productive" hours of my day, that I would rather spend doing something more fulfilling, whatever that might be.

Some of the suggestions I've read or heard over time are different versions of "Find a job that gives you flexibility and get a hobby outside work that fulfills you", and while that sounds like decent advise I still feel an empty feeling inside me to think that's how I'm going to spend the next 35 years of my life. I keep thinking about my son, and how I'm not setting a good life example by not being honest to myself.

I look around me and wonder how other software engineers feel in their lifes. I wonder the people in my company that pour themselves into their job, and makes me think what is the thing that drives them that I'm not getting.

Like I said, this could either be immaturity in my part, or perhaps I'm looking for something more in my life because I believe there might be a future where work + meaning can come together to live a more fulfilling life.

I'm not really looking for answers or advice, I've simply wanted to put my thoughts in writing for some time.

I'm really looking forward to read this at some point in the future where I've either moved forward in my life, or simply think how much of an idiot I was.

PS: I am aware of my privilege, and the fact I have the luxury to think about such problems when other people struggle to make ends meet. Knowing this doesn't help me feel less like there is something wrong about we live our lives, and being hopeful that there is a better future out there.
