What the fuck is career satisfaction?

- Why do I feel like I need to chase this constant job satisfaction? Does it really exist?
- Platforms like Linkedin, make you feel like you are obsolete when you are not involved in all the hype. Even if you recognise this bullshit, it still gets to you.
- Software engineers, like joiners or taxi drivers or any other proffession are just providing a service. A job is a job, it pays the bills for you to try and live a nice life. 
- Constantly changing companies every time you get bored or annoyed (every 2 years) might be fine if you want to make more money faster, or get yourself out of your comfort zone to keep learning new things. For me this was fine a few years ago. Now that I'm a parent I want my job to take as little of my time as possible. Find a nice company, with nice benefits, with a nice manager and a nice team who makes my life easy. Everything else is secondary (although I need to remind this to myself constantly).
- However, every so often, the career satisfaction monkey climbs over my back and whispers on my ear "Why stay? You could make more money elsewhere. You could be working with cooler AI tech elsewhere, rather than stagnating in your role". Usually at this point, I start to think about interviewing, finding something new. But deep down I know this will not give me the satisfaction I need. THe monkey will dissapear for a feaw months, but soon it will come back saying "Oh, this company is not good enough, lets start thinking of finding somewhere else ...".
- I'm trying to make my goal in life to live by the motto "Work to live". I have it pretty good considering: good industry, great company, and I more or less like what I do. The days of programming for fun are gone. Try to get as much satifsfaction fromt work that I can, but don't let the work define my life satisfaction. The end goal should be to work as littile as possible to maintain a good quality life to enjoy it with the family.
