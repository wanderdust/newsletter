      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my story of how I went from non-tech into becoming a Machine Learning Engineer. I must have told this story multiple times in many different forms, but this will be the first time it goes into writing. Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a bachelor’s degree in Commerce. I found the last few years of school so exhausting that the thought of doing an engineering degree put me off. Four + years of no life? Oft, no thanks. I also thought I wasn’t smart enough to do engineering anyway so instead I chose Commerce - which “coincidentally” was the same degree my brother was doing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
